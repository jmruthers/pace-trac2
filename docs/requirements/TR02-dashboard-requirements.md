# SLICE-02 — Dashboard — Requirements

**Document status:** Draft — rebuild implementation contract.  
**Companion authority:** `trac-project-brief.md`, `trac-architecture.md`.

---

## Orchestration metadata (canonical)

| Field | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Slice ID** | SLICE-02 |
| **Name** | Dashboard |
| **Bounded context** | Composite — Dashboard |
| **Owning routes** | `/`, `/dashboard` (home alias) |
| **Depends on** | SLICE-01; **substantive aggregates** after core domains (**minimum SLICE-03–07** implemented or stubbed with real data paths) |
| **Blocks** | — |
| **Implementation order** | 9 of 10 (per architecture — after domains so cards reflect real capability) |
| **High-risk** | Yes — composite: many upstream hooks; wrong build order yields hollow or wrong metrics |
| **Cross-cutting** | Aggregates planning, itinerary, costs, contacts; includes lightweight link to `/assignments` |

---

## Overview

Deliver the **event dashboard** at `/` and `/dashboard`: summary cards that reflect the **explicit v1 dashboard contract** in `trac-architecture.md` — planning counts, itinerary date range, costs, contacts, and lightweight assignments navigation — while using **pace-core2** UI and **`trac_status`** (not free-text status strings). Dashboard is **not** a primary nav item; users reach it via `/`.

- Prototype reference: event overview hero, KPI row, attention queue, and launcher grid in `pace-prototype/apps/pace-trac/pages/OverviewPage.jsx` (`EventOverviewPage` via `EventOverview` composite in `apps/_pace-core/prototype-only/EventOverview.jsx`; attention in `AttentionQueue.jsx`).

---

## Rebuild target

- **Event gating:** Event-scoped route behind pace-core2 **`ProtectedRoute requireEvent`** with one approved TRAC no-event fallback; once the route is entered, card loading/empty/error states are handled in-page.
- **Header:** Event title, logo (`core_events` / org storage per brief), tagline where available.
- **Planning card:** Link to `/planning`; **counts of confirmed vs total** for activities, transport, accommodation (enum-safe).
- **Itinerary card:** Link to `/itinerary`; earliest and latest visible dates from the SLICE-05 derived day-entry model, or explicit empty state.
- **Costs card:** Link to `/costs`; total and **per-participant** cost using **event base currency** (no hard-coded AUD), with the overall participant denominator taken from the **approved application count** for the active event; formatting via shared helpers.
- **Contacts card:** Link to `/contacts`; contact count.
- **Assignments link:** Include a lightweight **link** to **`/assignments`** (no extra assignment aggregate required for v1).
- **Partial failure:** Hybrid policy. Route/event gating failures are handled at the route/shell level by the shared TRAC no-event fallback. After route access is established, required event identity/header data is critical: if it cannot load, show a page-level error state. After header identity is established, cards degrade independently. A failure in one aggregate must not blank the whole dashboard; failed cards show inline error/retry messaging while successful cards still render. Empty states are not errors.
- **Permissions:** Read access gated by **`dashboard`** page key once the required TRAC page registration / permission seeding prerequisite is present on dev-db.
- **Person-aware data:** Where costs or counts depend on assignments/capacity, consume SLICE-04/07 data paths — no duplicate business rules.

## pace-core2 delta (vs legacy)

| Area | Rebuild |
|------|---------|
| Package/UI | `@solvera/pace-core` components and layout |
| Status filtering | `trac_status` enum |
| Assignments | Lightweight dashboard link to `/assignments` |
| Currency | Event base currency + `trac_currency_rates` behaviour per architecture |

---

## pace-core2 imports (expected)

| Need | Import path (expected) |
|------|------------------------|
| Guards | `@solvera/pace-core/rbac` — `PagePermissionGuard` for **`dashboard`** page key |
| Layout / cards | `@solvera/pace-core/components` |
| Event / org context | `@solvera/pace-core/providers` |
| Auth | `@solvera/pace-core` — `useUnifiedAuthContext` if needed |
| Theming | `@solvera/pace-core/theming` |

---

## Data and schema references

| Table / topic | Notes |
|---------------|--------|
| `trac_transport`, `trac_accommodation`, `trac_activity` | Counts by `trac_status`; capacity not required on dashboard card but may inform copy later |
| `trac_itinerary_assignment` | Optional future metrics; link to `/assignments` |
| `trac_currency_rates`, cost fields on logistics | For costs card — validate rollups vs brief |
| `core_events`, event logo storage | Header branding |
| **Supabase MCP (dev-db)** | Validate enums and column names before queries |

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. With event selected and permission granted, all summary cards render with **correct aggregates** per the architecture dashboard contract (counts, dates, costs, contacts).
2. Planning confirmed/total counts use **`trac_status`** only.
3. Costs display uses **event base currency** metadata — no literal AUD (or other) unless that is the event’s configured base.
4. Missing-event handling is provided by the shared route-level TRAC no-event fallback; the dashboard itself does not invent a second no-event pattern.
5. User without dashboard read permission cannot access metrics (guard or server denial with UI feedback).
6. Dashboard includes a lightweight `/assignments` link (without introducing new assignment aggregate metrics).
7. One failed aggregate card does not blank the whole dashboard.

### Layout (prototype parity targets — `EventOverviewPage`)

- [ ] `EventOverview` shell: breadcrumb Events → event name; page title = event name; subtitle on trip logistics scope.
- [ ] **Hero** region: `HeroLogo`, event title, meta rows (dates, venue, participant count), description, primary **Open planning** + secondary **View itinerary** actions.
- [ ] **KPI row** (four tiles): planning confirmed/total, itinerary day span, total event cost + per participant, open risks count (warm when > 0).
- [ ] **AttentionQueue** always rendered: heading **Needs attention** + count; warn-tone items when actionable; compact `EmptyState` in `Card` when caught up (**Nothing needs attention**).
- [ ] **Additional information** section: launcher grid (Contacts, Cost summary, Journal) with icon, title, description, optional count badge.

---

## API / Contract

- **Read-only** aggregates via pace-core2 secure Supabase client; RLS applies.
- Queries must be **event-scoped** (`event_id` / org context from providers).
- No direct writes from dashboard.
- Cost aggregation contract must align with **SLICE-07** (single source of rollup rules).

---

## Visual specification

### Event overview layout (prototype `EventOverviewPage`)

Prototype maps event overview to `#/events/:code` (nav label **Overview**). Production serves equivalent content at `/` and `/dashboard` per architecture.

### Prototype layout authority (pass 1)

The event overview does **not** render separate Planning / Itinerary / Costs / Contacts summary cards in the launcher region. Those domains surface via:

- **Hero actions:** Open planning, View itinerary
- **KPI row:** planning confirmed/total, itinerary span, total cost, open risks
- **Launchers (3):** External contacts, Cost summary, Journal

Architecture composite cards and `/assignments` link are **pass-2 production options** under Implementation delta — not prototype layout requirements.

**Region order (fixed scaffold inside `page-body`):**

1. `PageHeader` — breadcrumb, title, subtitle
2. `EntityHero` — `entity-hero` (media | body | `entity-hero-cta` actions)
3. KPI band — `section.section-gap-sm` > `div.kpi-grid` (four `KPI` tiles)
4. `AttentionQueue` — always present (see below)
5. **Additional information** — `section.section-gap` > `section-head` > `h2` + `div.launcher-grid`

**Page chrome (`EventOverview`):**

- Breadcrumb: **Events** → event name (current).
- Title: event name; subtitle describing transport, itinerary, costs, and risk scope.

**Hero band:**

- Media: event logo (`HeroLogo` with image or glyph fallback).
- Title repeat + meta list with icons: date range, venue, participant count.
- Event description paragraph when present.
- Actions: primary **Open planning** → `/planning`; secondary **View itinerary** → `/itinerary`.

**KPI grid (four `KPI` tiles):**

| Tile | Primary value | Detail line |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Planning confirmed | `{confirmed} / {total}` | logistics rows across three types |
| Itinerary | day count or em dash | earliest → latest dates or empty copy |
| Total event cost | formatted total | per participant + base currency |
| Open risks | `{open} / {total}` | warm styling when open > 0 |

**Attention queue (`AttentionQueue`):**

- Always render the section (do not omit when `items` is empty).
- Section head: `h2` **Needs attention** + count badge (`{n} item(s)`).
- When `items.length > 0`: warn-tone `atn-list` rows — icon, **title** + **kind** chip (e.g. Planning, Risks), **sub** line, trailing arrow; row navigates on click.
- When empty: `Card` wrapping compact `EmptyState` — title **Nothing needs attention**, description **You are all caught up — nothing to action right now.**
- Prototype item copy: **Logistics to confirm** (Planning) → planning; **Open risks** (Risks) → risks.

**Launcher grid (`launcher-grid`):**

Section heading **Additional information**; navigational cards (`button.launcher-card`):

| Launcher | Icon | Routes to |
|----------|------|-----------|
| External contacts | phone | `/contacts` |
| Cost summary | wallet | `/costs` |
| Journal | book | `/journal` |

Each card: `div.top` with `launcher-icon`, `h3` title, optional `launcher-count` (contacts, journal posts; costs launcher has no count); `p` description. Exactly three launchers in prototype (no planning/itinerary/risks/assignments tiles here).

### Architecture v1 dashboard cards (pass 2 alignment)

Architecture composite contract also specifies discrete cards linking to planning, itinerary, costs, contacts, plus `/assignments` link. Pass 2 may:

- Map KPI + launchers to explicit `Card`/`CardGrid` components per architecture, **or**
- Retain `EventOverview` composite if it satisfies the same links and metrics.

Either approach must use shared rollup helpers (SLICE-07) and CR25 date range for itinerary card.

### Loading and errors

- Per-card skeleton or inline loading; empty copy for zero contacts, no itinerary dates, etc.
- Independent card error states per hybrid partial-failure policy.

### Implementation delta (pass 2)

- Prototype route `#/events/:code` with **Overview** in primary nav; production dashboard at `/` without Overview nav label ([TR01](./TR01-platform-shell-requirements.md)).
- Prototype `EventOverview` composite bundles hero + KPIs + launchers; production `DashboardContent` may use separate cards — preserve metrics and links from architecture.
- Prototype uses mock `fmtAUD`; production uses event base currency.
- Master plan launcher in prototype is under itinerary full mode / overview copy — not a separate dashboard launcher (see [TR10](./TR10-master-plan-requirements.md)).

---

## Verification

- Manual walkthrough with planner role; spot-check numbers against raw SQL on **dev-db** for one fixture event.
- Confirm permission denial for role without dashboard read.

---

## Testing requirements

| # | Scenario | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | **Happy path:** Planner with event sees cards populated with expected counts and links | Integration (mocked Supabase) |
| 2 | **Validation / domain failure:** Event selected but upstream returns invalid enum — UI handles without crash; logs sane error | Integration |
| 3 | **Auth / permission failure:** User without **`read:page.dashboard`** — guard shows access denied / redirect | Integration |

Unit tests: pure helpers for date range reduction, count summaries (mocked inputs).

---

## Open questions

*(None — key is **`dashboard`**; required TRAC page registration / permission seeding is treated as a pre-build prerequisite per architecture.)*

---

## Do not

- Do not hard-code currency labels.
- Do not duplicate cost rollup logic that SLICE-07 owns — import shared module or service.
- Do not build this slice **before** SLICE-03–07 are far enough along to supply real aggregates (per implementation order).
